## How to write Clean Code?

You need to be a Craftsman.

> *But how to learn craftsmanship?*

There are two parts: knowledge and work. 

You must gain the knowledge of principles, patterns, practices, and heuristics that a craftsman knows, and you must also grind that knowledge into your ﬁngers, eyes, and gut by working hard and practicing.

## Why it's important to keep you code clean?

Bad code kills productivity in the long term, and bad productivity kills software companies.

> I think this happens mostly because of two things:
>
> 1. They won't be able to release new features as fast as their competitors;
> 2. The general cost of the software increases;

Therefore, keep the code clean should be in the DNA of a software company. The paragraph below makes an awesome analogy with this:

> *"A building with broken windows looks like nobody cares about it. So other people stop caring. They allow more windows to become broken. Eventually they actively break them. They despoil the facade with grafﬁti and allow garbage to collect. One broken window starts the process toward decay."*

## Clean code characteristic

1. Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author.
2. It has unit and acceptance tests. 
3. It has meaningful names.
